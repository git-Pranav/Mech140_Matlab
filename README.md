# Mech140_Matlab

This folder is created as a part of the MECH140 undergraduate course offering at Santa Clara University conducted by Dr. Mohammed Ayoubi. 

The four scripts are a solution to the questions from the book Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Mariam/Kreige 7th Edition.

These scripts are solely meant for educational purposes and are meant to act as a guide for students to use different ODE and solvers to solve 
differential equations and dynamic problems.
